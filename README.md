# Hankbot3000

## The world's premiere Dungeons & Dragons helper bot. 

Kicks dice across a dirt floor to roll them, retrieves spell card descriptions, translates suspiciously similarly to Google, and will also speak said translations aloud. Hank also has additional hidden commands to serve the DM's nefarious purposes.

## Prefix 

Hank's prefix is `bak`. This is nonnegotiable. 

## Help

If you or a loved one are ever overwhelmed by Hank's presence and sheer capability, the `help` command is here for you. 

| **Command** | **Example Usage** | **Description** |
| :-----------:|:-------------:|:----------------:| 
| `help` | `bak help` | Opens this help menu. |
| `ping` | `bak ping` |Hank sends back a pong. | 
| `roll` | `bak roll 1d4 + 2` | Have Hank roll your dice. | 
| `spell` | `bak spell fireball` | Search for a spell card. | 
| `dog` | `bak dog` | Hank will provide a picture of a dog. | 
| `say` | `bak say fr Hello` | Hank will translate the text into the provided language code, join the voice channel, and speak the translation. | 
| `translate` | `bak translate ru Howdy` | Hank will send an embed of the translated text in the same channel. | 
| `accent` | `bak accent es Whassup` | Hank will read the provided text in the accent specified. | 
| `languages` | `bak languages` | Hank instructs you on the available languages for translation. | 


## Dice 

Hankbot works alongside [rpg-dice-roller](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rpg-dice-roller) to roll dice of any shape. Even that **D17** you were thinking about.

To use the command, simply type something akin to `bak roll 1d20 + 2`, `bak roll 1d100 - 22` or even `bak r 1d37`. Hank can roll 'em all.


## Spells

Hankbot has exclusive access to all the sourcebooks. Just kidding. He does have a fondness for the [D&D 5th Edition API](http://www.dnd5eapi.co/docs) though.

To see a spellcard, Hank responds best to something along the lines of `bak spell hideous laughter`.


## Translations & Accents

Hank, also known as Mr. World Wide (no relation), can translate just like [Google](https://cloud.google.com/translate). 

What are all the languages, you ask? What an *excellent* question!

| **Code** | **Language** |
|:--------:|:------------:|
| ar  | Arabic |
| zh  | Chinese |
| en  | English |
| fr  | French |
| de  | German |
| hi  | Hindi |
| it  | Italian |
| ja  | Japanese |
| ko  | Korean |
| pt  | Portuguese |
| ru  | Russian |
| es  | Spanish |


## Bird Noises

Hank, as you all know, is a chicken that looks suspiciously like a penguin. Naturally. This is not a surprise to anyone.

If you don't believe us, try using the command `bak bak`. Hank will tell you what's what.

## Secret DM Commands (Don't Tell My Players. Please.)
